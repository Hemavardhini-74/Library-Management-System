# Library-Management-System
A library management system is software that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. The main aim of this system is to develop a new programmed system and to make available a channel through which staff can maintain the record easily and customers can access the information about the library. The library also keeps the record of suppliers and publishers for each categories of books. It keeps track of all the information about the books in the library, their cost, status and total number of books available in the library. The user will find it easy in this automated system rather than using the manual writing system. The system contains a database where all the information will be stored safely.
